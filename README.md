# Numerical

This project contains different types of numerical algorithms with following categories:
1.  random number generator (both discrete and continous)
2.  more coming soon


## Random Number Generator
pseudorandom random number is generated based on the following rule:

![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.download?X_%7Bn%20+%201%7D%20%3D%20%28a%20*%20X_%7Bn%7D%20+%20b%29%20%5Cquad%20mod%20%5Cquad%20m)

with (LGM)Lewis Goodman, Miller - IBM, a = 7^5, b = 0 and m = 2^31 - 1.
### Discrete
#### Uniform distribtion
